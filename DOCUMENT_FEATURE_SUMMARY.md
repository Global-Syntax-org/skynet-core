# Document Upload Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ FEATURE COMPLETED: Document Upload and Management for Skynet Core

Your request to **"ADD a feature allowing upload of docs"** has been successfully implemented! Here's what was built:

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Backend Components

1. **Document Processor (`skynet/document_processor.py`)**
   - Handles file upload, processing, and storage
   - Supports multiple file formats: PDF, DOCX, XLSX, TXT, MD, CSV
   - Automatic text extraction and chunking for AI processing
   - Document search with relevance scoring
   - User-specific document isolation

2. **API Endpoints (`web/app.py`)**
   - `POST /api/documents/upload` - Upload new documents
   - `GET /api/documents/list` - List user's documents
   - `DELETE /api/documents/<id>` - Delete specific document
   - `GET /api/documents/search` - Search document content

3. **AI Integration (`skynet/assistant.py`)**
   - Enhanced chat method to include document context
   - Automatic document search for relevant content
   - Context injection into AI responses
   - Maintains backward compatibility

### Frontend Components

1. **Document Manager Modal (`web/templates/document_manager.html`)**
   - Bootstrap 5 responsive modal interface
   - Drag & drop file upload with visual feedback
   - Document list with actions (delete, ask about document)
   - File validation and progress indicators
   - Toast notifications for user feedback

2. **Main Interface Updates (`web/templates/index.html`)**
   - Added "Documents" button to navigation
   - Integrated Bootstrap 5 CDN
   - Modal trigger and notification system

## 🎯 Key Features

### Document Management
- **Upload Support**: PDF, Word, Excel, Text, Markdown, CSV files
- **File Validation**: MIME type checking, size limits (10MB max)
- **Text Extraction**: Automatic content extraction from all supported formats
- **Chunking**: Intelligent text segmentation for AI processing
- **Metadata Storage**: Document info, upload time, chunk count tracking

### Search & Discovery
- **Content Search**: Find relevant document sections based on user queries
- **Relevance Scoring**: Simple but effective text-based ranking
- **Multi-document Search**: Search across all user documents simultaneously
- **Context Integration**: Search results automatically included in chat responses

### User Experience
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive file upload interface
- **Visual Feedback**: Upload progress, success/error states
- **Document List**: View all uploaded documents with metadata
- **Quick Actions**: Delete documents or ask questions about specific files
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### AI Integration
- **Context-Aware Responses**: AI includes relevant document content in answers
- **Automatic Search**: User questions trigger document search automatically
- **Fallback Graceful**: Works with or without AI models available
- **User-Specific**: Documents are private to each logged-in user

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload**: File received via web API
2. **Validation**: MIME type and size checking
3. **Storage**: Save to user-specific directory
4. **Processing**: Extract text content using appropriate library
5. **Chunking**: Split text into manageable segments
6. **Indexing**: Store metadata and chunks for search

### Document Storage Structure
```
uploads/
├── user123_abc123_document.pdf          # Original file
├── user123_abc123_document.pdf.json     # Metadata + chunks
└── user456_def456_report.docx           # User-specific isolation
```

### Search Algorithm
- Simple text-based search with frequency scoring
- Case-insensitive matching
- Relevance ranking by query term frequency
- Top-N results limiting for performance

### Security Considerations
- User-specific document isolation
- File type validation
- Size limits to prevent abuse
- No direct file serving (metadata only)

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For End Users
1. **Access**: Click "Documents" button in navigation
2. **Upload**: Drag files into upload area or click to browse
3. **Manage**: View uploaded documents in the list
4. **Search**: Ask questions and get document-informed responses
5. **Clean Up**: Delete documents when no longer needed

### For Developers
1. **Testing**: Run `python test_document_integration.py`
2. **Demo**: Run `python demo_document_feature.py`
3. **Web Server**: Start with `python web/app.py`
4. **Extensions**: Modify `DocumentProcessor` class for new features
